The date selection slider allows you to easily navigate to any date in the current ISP billing interval.  If you click the `star` beside the name of the view, your reports will default to that tab (or change the `Default View` on the Summary tab<\/p>\n\t\t<p><img src='\/images\/date-selection.png'><\/p>\n\t\t<p>The buttons to the left and right of the slider allow you see date for the previous\/next day, first\/last day of the current interval or the previous\/next intervals.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>NB - YAMon aggregates data by `billing intervals` rather than strictly by month...  The first day of a billing interval is determined by the value of `_ispBillingDay` in your config.file (which is the value you entered during the initial setup script).<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class='intro-t hidden'>\n\t\t<h1><span class='settings-tab settings'><\/span>Settings<\/h1>\n\t\t<p>The `Settings` tab allows you to configure how data is presented in the reports.  By default, these settings and any customizations you make for device names & groupings are saved in a `<a href='https:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/html\/html5_webstorage.asp' target='_blank'>LocalStorage<\/a>` variable which means that your settings are specific to this browser and this device.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you plan to view these reports from multiple devices, I recommend that you look at the `Database Integration` settings which will share your settings with any device used to view these reports. See detailed `Database Integration` instructions <a href='https:\/\/usage-monitoring.com\/help\/?t=share-settings' target='_blank'>here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you want to use the new access restrictions feature (i.e., prevent certain devices from accessing the web at certain times of the day or days of the week), you <b><u>must<\/u><\/b> enable the database integration.

See detailed instructions <a href='https:\/\/usage-monitoring.com\/help\/?t=users-js' target='_blank'>here<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t<p>Once you've tweaked all of the values as appropriate for your network, you can export the information by clicking the <span class='intro-export'><\/span> icon.  This will generate a new `users.js` file that you can copy to your router.

You have full control over which devices can\/cannot access the web based upon the way that you logically organize the devices on  the `Devices` tab.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This means that you can shut off the internet for your children between 9PM & 7AM on school nights (Sun-Thurs) and between 11PM & 9AM on weekends... you have full control over the times, days (and even months).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There are also ways to block or unblock the devices for a specific duration - e.g., unblock devices for the next 30min so your child can finish the report which is due tomorrow\n\t\t<p>See detailed instructions <a href='https:\/\/usage-monitoring.com\/current\/SetAccessRestrictions.php' target='_blank'>here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class='intro-t hidden'>\n\t\t<h1><span class='settings-tab settings'><\/span>ISP Integration<\/h1>\n\t\t<p>If you want to compare your YAMon traffic reports with those provided by your ISP, check out the `ISP Settings` too.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This will allow you to see how YAMon's values differ from what your ISP reports.
